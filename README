Description:
This is a small script which allows you to 
organize elemets within variable containers. 

The elements and folder are database (mysql) tagged and you 
are able to sort them and tag them via frontend.

In the backend PHP is used to handle the javascript request and save tags in the database. 

The frontend is completly made in HTML5.
Some CSS3 is used and jquery is needed.
The animation was made with jquery.

Files:
dbdumb.sql can be used to build the database structure for this project
jsbase/main.js is the javascript file for the animation
globals.inc.php has the database config and the main php function to move elements
loadElement.php is loaded by javascript to show a valid box within the new container
index.php is for building the frontend.
